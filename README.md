Classification Algorithms
Overview

Classification is a supervised machine learning task in which a model learns from labeled data and assigns an input to one of several predefined categories or classes. It is widely used in domains such as text analysis, image recognition, medical diagnosis, and fraud detection.

How Classification Works

Data Collection
A dataset is collected where each data point consists of input features and a corresponding class label.

Feature Representation
Raw data is transformed into numerical features that can be processed by machine learning models.

Model Training
A classification algorithm learns a mapping between input features and class labels using training data.

Decision Boundary Learning
The model identifies boundaries or rules that separate different classes in the feature space.

Prediction
For a new, unseen input, the trained model predicts the most likely class based on learned patterns.

Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
