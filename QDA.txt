Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
1. Definition

Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) is a supervised classification algorithm based on Bayesian decision theory. It models each class using a separate multivariate Gaussian distribution, allowing non-linear decision boundaries.

2. Objective

QDA aims to classify data points by:

Estimating class-specific probability distributions

Assigning a sample to the class with the highest posterior probability

Unlike LDA, QDA allows each class to have its own covariance matrix, providing greater flexibility.

3. Assumptions

QDA makes the following assumptions:

Features within each class follow a Gaussian distribution

Each class has its own covariance matrix

Features are continuous

Observations are independent

4. Mathematical Model
Class-Conditional Probability

For class 
𝑐
P(x∣y=c)=N(x∣μc​,Σc​)

Discriminant Function

The QDA discriminant function is:

δc​(x)=−21​log∣Σc​∣−21​(x−μc​)TΣc−1​(x−μc​)+logP(y=c)

A data point is assigned to the class with the maximum discriminant score.

5. Why Decision Boundary Is Quadratic

Because each class has its own covariance matrix, the resulting decision boundary includes quadratic terms in the feature space.
This allows QDA to model curved and complex boundaries.

6. QDA vs LDA
Aspect	QDA	LDA
Supervised	Yes	Yes
Covariance	Different for each class	Same for all classes
Decision Boundary	Quadratic (non-linear)	Linear
Flexibility	High	Moderate
Overfitting Risk	Higher	Lower
Data Requirement	Large dataset	Smaller dataset
7. When to Use QDA

Use QDA when:

Class boundaries are non-linear

Each class has a distinct covariance structure

You have enough training data

LDA underfits the data

8. Advantages

Captures complex class relationships

More expressive than LDA

Performs well when class distributions differ significantly

9. Limitations

Requires estimating many parameters

Sensitive to small sample sizes

Can overfit when data is limited

Computationally more expensive than LDA

10. Common Applications

Medical diagnostics

Financial risk classification

Pattern recognition

Image and signal classification

11. Key Insight

LDA is a special case of QDA where all classes share the same covariance matrix.
