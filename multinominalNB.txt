Multinomial Distribution
Explanation

A multinomial distribution is used when there are multiple possible outcomes and an experiment is repeated a fixed number of times.
Instead of tracking each individual outcome, we record how many times each outcome occurs.

Each outcome represents a category, and the final result is a set of counts, one for each category. The total of all counts is equal to the number of trials performed.

Key Points

Multiple discrete outcomes

Fixed number of trials

Data is represented as counts

Counts are non-negative integers

Counts together represent the full outcome

Intuition

Think of repeating the same experiment many times and then summarizing the result by counting how often each category appeared.

Usage

Multinomial distribution is commonly used in:

Text and document data represented as word counts

Event frequency analysis

Probabilistic classification models

One-Line Summary

Multinomial distribution describes how many times each category occurs in a fixed number of observations.
