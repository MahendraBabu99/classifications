Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
1. Definition

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and dimensionality reduction. It projects data onto a lower-dimensional space while maximizing class separability.

2. Objective

LDA aims to find a linear transformation that:

Maximizes between-class variance

Minimizes within-class variance

This ensures that samples from different classes are as far apart as possible, while samples within the same class are tightly clustered.

3. Assumptions

LDA is based on the following assumptions:

Data for each class follows a Gaussian (normal) distribution

All classes share the same covariance matrix

Features are continuous

Observations are independent

4. Mathematical Intuition
Class Means

For each class 
μc​=Nc​1​i∈c∑​xi​	​

Overall Mean
μ=N1​i=1∑N​xi​	​

Within-Class Scatter Matrix
SW​=c∑​i∈c∑​(xi​−μc​)(xi​−μc​)T

Between-Class Scatter Matrix
SB​=c∑​Nc​(μc​−μ)(μc​−μ)T

Optimization Objective

W=argmax(∣WTSW​W∣∣WTSB​W∣​)

This leads to solving a generalized eigenvalue problem.

5. Dimensionality Reduction Property

If there are C classes, LDA can produce at most:

𝐶
−
1
 components
C−1 components

Example:

2 classes → 1 component

3 classes → 2 components

6. Classification Rule

After projection:

Each class is modeled using a Gaussian distribution

A new sample is assigned to the class with the highest posterior probability

7. LDA vs PCA
Aspect	LDA	PCA
Type	Supervised	Unsupervised
Uses Labels	Yes	No
Goal	Class separation	Variance maximization
Components	≤ C − 1	≤ number of features
8. When to Use LDA

Use LDA when:

You have labeled data

Class distributions are approximately Gaussian

Classes are linearly separable

You want both dimensionality reduction and classification

9. Limitations

Performs poorly if covariance matrices differ significantly

Not suitable for highly non-linear class boundaries

Sensitive to outliers

10. Common Applications

Face recognition

Medical diagnosis
