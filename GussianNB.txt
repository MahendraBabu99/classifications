Gaussian Naive Bayes (Gaussian NB)
Overview

Gaussian Naive Bayes is a probabilistic, supervised classification algorithm based on Bayes’ Theorem.
It is used when features are continuous and are assumed to follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution within each class.

Core Idea

A data point belongs to the class for which the probability of observing its feature values is highest, assuming features are independent and normally distributed.

Bayes’ Theorem

Compute mean and variance of each feature per class

Prediction Phase

Compute likelihoods using the Gaussian formula

Multiply likelihoods with class prior

Choose the class with the highest posterior probability

Key Assumptions

Features are independent given the class

Features follow a Gaussian distribution

Equal importance of features
