Radius Neighbors Classifier
Overview

The Radius Neighbors Classifier is a distance-based, supervised classification algorithm.
It assigns a class label to a data point based on the labels of all training samples within a fixed radius around that point.

It is a variant of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), but instead of using a fixed number of neighbors, it uses a fixed distance threshold.

Core Idea

A data point belongs to the class that is most common among all training points lying within a specified radius.

How Radius Neighbors Classification Works

Choose a radius 
𝑟
r
This defines the neighborhood size around a query point.

Compute distances
Calculate the distance between the query point and all training points
(commonly Euclidean distance).

Select neighbors within the radius
Only points satisfying:

distance(x,xi​)≤r

Majority voting
The predicted class is the most frequent class among selected neighbors.

No neighbors case
If no points fall within the radius:

The model may return no prediction


Distance Metrics Supported

Euclidean distance

Manhattan distance

Minkowski distance

Custom distance functions

When to Use Radius Neighbors Classifier

Data has varying density

You want local influence only

You want to ignore far-away points

Clusters have meaningful spatial boundaries

Advantages

Simple and intuitive

Adapts to local data density

No training phase (lazy learning)

Flexible distance metrics

Limitations

Sensitive to radius selection

Poor performance in high-dimensional data

No prediction if neighborhood is empty

Computationally expensive for large datasets

Common Applications

Spatial data classification

Anomaly-aware classification

Pattern recognition

Small to medium-sized datasets

Key Insight

Radius Neighbors Classifier focuses on proximity, not count — classification depends on who lies close enough, not how many neighbors are forced.
Or fall back to a default strategy (implementation-dependent)
